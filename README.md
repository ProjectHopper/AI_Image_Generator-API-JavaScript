<h3>ðŸ›‘ Built an AI Image Generator in JavaScript! | OpenAI API DALL-E ChatGPT</h3>
</br>
</br>
In this project, I built an AI image generator in JavaScript using the OpenAI API, which provides access to powerful models such as ChatGPT and DALLÂ·E 3. 
</br>
ChatGPT is a conversational agent that can answer questions, generate creative ideas, and help refine prompts. 
</br>
DALLÂ·E 3 is an image synthesis model that can create images from text descriptions with high fidelity and detail.
</br>
By combining these two models, I created a web app that allows users to chat with ChatGPT and request images from DALLÂ·E 3 based on their input. 
</br>
The app also displays the generated images and the prompts used to create them. 
</br>
This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API with JavaScript and how to integrate different models to create a novel and interactive application.
